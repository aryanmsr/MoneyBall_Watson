- 5 datafiles are from the main dataset: 
games.csv, games_details.csv, teams.csv, players.csv, ranking.csv

- 2 datafiles are created by running Notebook 1.Data_Preprocessing_and_Feature_Engineering
reg_2015.csv, elo_2015.csv

- To run the models, make sure to run the notebooks in order, starting from 
  -  1.Data_Preprocessing_and_Feature_Engineering
  -  2.Exploratory_Data_Analysis 
  -  3.Modeling.

- The datafile games_details.csv should be unzipped. 

## Introduction

*As sports betting continues to rise in popularity, we are curious to see how accurately we can construct a binary classification model to predict wins and losses during the regular season games in the NBA. Our ultimate goal is to use machine learning techniques to capture useful information from game statistics and matchups to predict the winner of each game. The findings will help us identify potential factors concerning how teams win along with valuable insights for NBA sports gambling and fantasy basketball participants.*
